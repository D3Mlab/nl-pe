Affordable, photogenic, and friendly, it’s a dreamy nest for creatives and wanderers drawn to color and mountain air.', 'doc_97': 'Panama City’s Casco Viejo sets the scene for this colonial-era boutique stay. Balconied rooms overlook pastel facades and plazas; interiors blend tiled floors, rattan, and crisp linens. A rooftop pool and bar savor ocean breezes. The restaurant riffs on ceviche and tropical produce. Steps from galleries and cafés, it’s lively but civilized. Service is attentive and bilingual. For travelers who love historic districts with contemporary energy, it’s a sweet spot.', 'doc_98': 'In Switzerland’s Zermatt, a chalet hotel gazes at the Matterhorn like a chapel to peaks. Pine-clad rooms are plush and warm; some feature fireplaces and soaking tubs. An alpine spa, fondue dinners, and a snug bar round out days on the slopes. Car-free streets, efficient lifts, and glacier views make logistics smooth. Classic, cozy, and quietly upscale, it’s a mountain retreat for skiers and summer hikers who worship good snow and crisp, clean air.', 'doc_99': 'Malaysia’s Langkawi rainforest embraces this luxe nature resort between limestone cliffs and a private beach. Stilted villas float among trees; macaques and hornbills visit balconies. A spa rooted in Malay healing traditions pairs with jungle treks and kayaks through mangroves. Restaurants source island produce and seafood. Sustainability efforts protect wildlife corridors. Serene, romantic, and deeply green, it’s for travelers who want five-star comfort wrapped in birdsong and leaf-filtered light.', 'doc_100': 'In the heart of Nairobi’s airport corridor, this smart transit hotel delivers rest between flights. Soundproof rooms, blackout blinds, and pressure-relieving mattresses combat jet lag. Showers are hot and fast; day-use rates and hourly bookings fit odd itineraries. A grab-and-go café, reliable Wi-Fi, and transfers keep stress low. Clean, efficient, and secure, it’s not about spectacle—just precisely what weary travelers need to recharge and move on.'}}\n"
