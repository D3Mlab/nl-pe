near term gp experiments (nov 23):
-----
- dense with gemini full, 48
- gp tuned with gemini, 48, full ... does dim red matter
- try no observation noise

-try refitting
- try gradient enchanced
-ucb

-warm start? 25%,50%,75% ... some warm start seems like a good idea, the start of the ranking should be quite informative ... can use gp full embeddings

- contextual bandits

- future... adaptive gp? once there is no relevant doc in a batch (for x batches) switch modes to gp? will this be hard to explain?
