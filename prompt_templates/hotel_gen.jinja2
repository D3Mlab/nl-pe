Generate 100 hotel descriptions from around the world. Each description should be about 100 words long and highlight the hotel’s location, amenities, atmosphere, and what makes it unique. Include a diverse mix of hotels — luxury, boutique, seaside resorts, mountain lodges, city business hotels, and budget-friendly stays — but ensure diversity not just by type, but across dimensions such as price range, travel style, and geographic location.

Return the results in valid JSON with the following format:

{
  "doc_1": "<Description of Hotel 1 (≈100 words)>",
  "doc_2": "<Description of Hotel 2 (≈100 words)>",
  ...
  "doc_100": "<Description of Hotel 2 (≈100 words)>",
}
